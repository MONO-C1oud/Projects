To run the server just `git clone` and use run this command:
  
    python3 flask_server.py
    
Run the `client.py` script on the victim machines after changing the ip to create a botnet.

## Downloading and Uploading files

Use `download <filename>` to download the files from the bot to the c2's `outputs` folder.

Use `upload <filename>` to upload the file from the c2's base directory to the bot's directory from where the script was executed.
